# Lie Detector 
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Starter Project: Jitterbug


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aJ8D_24M1k?si=ZHzQcDe4stBDzNmZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>




 The **[Jitterbug](https://learntosolderkits.com/products/jitterbug)** involved soldering ca vibration motor, two red LEDs, a switch, and a battery holder onto a custom PCB. Once completed, the Jitterbug uses the motor to skitter across hard surfaces. I really enjoyed this starter project since it allowed me to learn how to solder and really got me into the mood for my summer at BlueStamp.

# Challenges
A major challenge I faced was that one of the jitterbugs eyes were not lighting up. After playing with it I realized that the issue was that the led was oriented the wrong way. To fix this, I had to desolder the LED, flip it around, and finally put it back in and solder it. **From this I learned how to desolder and take out components.**




# Components Used

- 1 x Jitterbug PCB
- 2 x LED (Red)
- 1 x Vibration Motor
- 1 x Switch
- 1 x Coin Cell Battery (3V)
- 1 x Battery Holder
- 1 x Cut Wire
